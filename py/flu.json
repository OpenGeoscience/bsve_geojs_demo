Details of the case A 38-year-old, non-national male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on 21 September and, on 28 September, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 30 September. Currently, he is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. Investigation of history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing. (Continue . . . ) &nbsp;   Although nearly half (45%) of all known MERS cases are acquired through hospital or healthcare exposure, nearly as many (42%) are either primary (community acquired) or unclassified.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Some of these primary cases are probably the result of camel exposure, but likely that only makes up a small percentage. &nbsp; Most of these primary cases have no known exposure history  like the 38 year-old cited above  which has led to speculation that some degree of",

They are quick, convenient and reasonably inexpensive - but their accuracy has come under scrutiny in the past (see MMWR: Evaluating RIDTs).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In this 2012 study, 11 commercially available Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests that were were tested against 23 flu viruses (16 A &amp; 6&nbsp; B strains) that have circulated in the United States since 2006. Each virus was tested at five different dilution strengths, in order to gauge relative sensitivity of these tests.   &nbsp; All but one managed to correctly return a positive result at the highest tested viral concentration, but at lower titers the results were highly variable. &nbsp; The two main measures of the accuracy of a diagnostic test are sensitivity and specificity.      Sensitivity is defined as the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals who have a given disease or condition.   Specificity is defined a",

The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said on Wednesday that it will set up a task force and take special quarantine measures for the next eight months from October 1 to May 31 next year to prevent the spread of AI and the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The ministry said that it will set a date to disinfect traditional markets and shut down shops selling poultry products at the markets immediately if AI cases are confirmed&nbsp; there. Since the bird flu virus was reported at duck farms in Naju and Gangjin in South Jeolla Province on September 18, some 27-thousand poultry have been culled. &nbsp; &nbsp; From the Korean Herald, we get a longer report that suggests the return of AI this fall may have been due to a reactivation of a `dormant virus, and not a fresh introduction.&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, this would speak to persistence of the virus in the environment.  &nbsp;      Gov't to step up measures t",

During this season, besides offering LAIV to all two to four year olds, several areas piloted vaccination of primary (4-11 years) and secondary (11-13 years) age children. Influenza A(H3N2) circulated, with strains genetically and antigenically distinct from the 2014/15 A(H3N2) vaccine strain, followed by a drifted B strain. We assessed the overall and indirect impact of vaccinating school age children, comparing cumulative disease incidence in targeted and non-targeted age groups in vaccine pilot to non-pilot areas. Uptake levels were 56.8% and 49.8% in primary and secondary school pilot areas respectively. In primary school age pilot areas, cumulative primary care influenza-like consultation, emergency department respiratory attendance, respiratory swab positivity, hospitalisation and excess respiratory mortality were consistently lower in targeted and non-targeted age groups, though less for adults and more severe end-points, compared with non-pilot areas. There was no significant reduction for excess all-cause mortality. Little impact was seen in secondary school age pilot only areas compared with non-pilot areas.

        "Content": "The 2014/15 influenza season was the second season of roll-out of a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) programme for healthy children in England. During this season, besides offering LAIV to all two to four year olds, several areas piloted vaccination of primary (4-11 years) and secondary (11-13 years) age children. Influenza A(H3N2) circulated, with strains genetically and antigenically distinct from the 2014/15 A(H3N2) vaccine strain, followed by a drifted B strain. We assessed the overall and indirect impact of vaccinating school age children, comparing cumulative disease incidence in targeted and non-targeted age groups in vaccine pilot to non-pilot areas. Uptake levels were 56.8% and 49.8% in primary and secondary school pilot areas respectively. In primary school age pilot areas, cumulative primary care influenza-like consultation, emergency department respiratory attendance, respiratory swab positivity, hospitalisation and excess respiratory mortality were consistently lower in targeted and non-targeted age groups, though less for adults and more severe end-points, compared with non-pilot areas. There was no significant reduction for excess all-cause mortality. Little impact was seen in secondary school age pilot only areas compared with non-pilot areas. Vaccination of healthy primary school age children resulted in population-level impact despite circulation of drifted A and B influenza strains.",

Day, where it is hoped the the&nbsp; combined preparedness messaging delivered during National Preparedness Month will inspire you to take proactive steps to become better prepared for any emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But if that isnt enough inspiration, weve also got the first hurricane in the Western Atlantic for the 2015 tropical season, and it poses a potential late-weekend threat to the Atlantic coast of the United States.  &nbsp; The National Hurricane Center is quick to point out that there is a good deal of uncertainty in the track of this storm right now.&nbsp; In their 11am Discussion they stress: &nbsp;  KEY MESSAGES: 1. Confidence in the details of the track forecast late in the period remains low, since the environmental steering currents are complex and the model guidance is inconsistent. A wide range of outcomes is possible, from a direct impact of a major hurricane along the U.S. east coast to a track of Joaquin out to sea away from the coast. It is therefore way too soon to talk about specific wind, rain, or surge impacts from Joaquin in the U.S.  2. Should the threat to the U.S. increase, any further adjustments of the forecast to the west would likely be accompanied by an increase in the forecast forward speed, with impacts along the coast occurring sooner than currently forecast. A hurricane watch could be required for portions of the U.S. coast as early as Thursday evening.  3. Many areas of the eastern U.S. are currently experiencing heavy rains and gusty winds associated with a frontal system. This inclement weather is expected to continue over the next few days, which could complicate preparations for Joaquin should it head toward the coast.  &nbsp; &n",

Day, where it is hoped the the&nbsp; combined preparedness messaging delivered during National Preparedness Month will inspire you to take proactive steps to become better prepared for any emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But if that isnt enough inspiration, weve also got the first hurricane in the Western Atlantic for the 2015 tropical season, and it poses a potential late-weekend threat to the Atlantic coast of the United States.  &nbsp; The National Hurricane Center is quick to point out that there is a good deal of uncertainty in the track of this storm right now.&nbsp; In their 11am Discussion they stress: &nbsp;  KEY MESSAGES: 1. Confidence in the details of the track forecast late in the period remains low, since the environmental steering currents are complex and the model guidance is inconsistent. A wide range of outcomes is possible, from a direct impact of a major hurricane along the U.S. east coast to a track of Joaquin out to sea away from the coast. It is therefore way too soon to talk about specific wind, rain, or surge impacts from Joaquin in the U.S.  2. Should the threat to the U.S. increase, any further adjustments of the forecast to the west would likely be accompanied by an increase in the forecast forward speed, with impacts along the coast occurring sooner than currently forecast. A hurricane watch could be required for portions of the U.S. coast as early as Thursday evening.  3. Many areas of the eastern U.S. are currently experiencing heavy rains and gusty winds associated with a frontal system. This inclement weather is expected to continue over the next few days, which could complicate preparations for Joaquin should it head toward the coast.  &nbsp; &n",

This month, as part of NPM15, Ill be rerunning some edited and updated older preparedness essays, along with some new ones.  &nbsp; # 10,562 Last August, in USGS: Nearly Half Of U.S. Population Exposed to Potentially Damaging Earthquakes, we looked at the results of a new study  published in the journal Earthquake Spectra, that&nbsp;nearly doubles  to 143 million - the number of Americans who live or work in areas susceptible to potentially damaging ground shaking. &nbsp;  Of particular note, since research is still ongoing, this study didnt consider earthquakes due to human activity  such as `Fracking - nor does it take into consideration the amplification of ground shaking due to soil type, which could exacerbate the effects of some earthquakes. Add in non-seismically active regions along the Gulf and Atlantic coastlines that are susceptible to tsunamis generated from distant earthquakes (see #NatlPrep : Tsunami Awareness), and there is better than a 50-50 chance that you live somewhere that is at risk of some seismically induced disaster.  &nbsp;  Although California, Alaska, and Hawaii are first thought of when it comes to U.S. earthquakes, there are three other major areas of concern (and a lot of second tier threats).&nbsp;  Perhaps best known is the New Madrid fault, which makes up the bull's-eye in the center of the nation on the seismic map above. Just over 200 years ago  when that area of the country was sparsely populated  this was the scene of 4 major quakes over a two year period.&nbsp; Today, millions of people live in  and much of the nations transportation crosses  this seismic hotspot (see USGS: New Madrid Simulation Shows Risks For Memphis &amp; Little Rock).  &nbsp; Lesser known, but probably a bigger threat, is the",

Todays case report  that of a 90 y.o. man listed in critical condition  doesnt give us much to go on in that regard.&nbsp; Additionally, the MOH reports 5 recent recoveries.    &nbsp; New in todays report is a fresh graphic (see bottom chart), representing the likely source of infection for Saudi MERS cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Health Care workers and Family Contacts each come in with about 12%, and nearly 1/3rd of cases are hapless hospital patients infected during their stay when a MERS patient is hospitalized in the same facility.&nbsp; Another 5% are unclassified.   The biggest portion of cases are listed as PRIMARY infections, and here we have very little information as to how these people came to be exposed and&nbsp; infected.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Camel or camel products may account for some of them, but probably only a small percentage. The role of mild or asymptomatic cases in facilitating the community spread of MERS remains an intriguing, plausible - but as yet unproven - theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  More than two years after the World Health Organization first called on the Saudis to conduct a case-control study  one which ought to provide answers to many of these questions - we have yet to see one.  &nbsp; An omission that continues to frustrate the global scientific community, and potentially increases the risk to global public health from this emerging MERS Coronavirus.",

At least two HPAI viruses are expected this fall  H5N2 and H5N8  although we may also see a return of the (North American version) of H5N1, and the arrival new reassortants or subtypes cannot be ruled out.  &nbsp; These viruses turned up for the first time in North American wild birds a little less than a year ago, presumably carried in by migratory birds from Asia.&nbsp; The versions weve seen so far  unlike their Asian cousins  have not shown the ability to infect humans.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hopefully that bit of luck will continue, but the CDC is making contingency plans (see EID Journal: Infection Risk To Those Exposed To HPAI H5 Viruses  United States) in case it doesnt.  &nbsp; These viruses are believed likely now endemic in North American waterfowl, and are expected to spread again across the nation during their fall migration from their summer breeding areas. Unlike last spring, when all of the activity was confined to the Pacific, Central and Mississippi flyways, the entire nation is on alert.    Credit FWS.GOV  &nbsp; In many ways, the USDA, APHIS, and the entire poultry industry could be said to be on a war footing.&nbsp; Theyve spent the summer gearing up, developing rules of engagement, and bulking up their defenses  all the while hoping the battle can somehow be averted.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; Over the past couple of days weve looked at some of these updated battle plans (see APHIS: Fall 2015 HPAI Preparedness &amp; Response Plan&nbsp; &amp; Ventilator Shutdown As A Poultry Depopulation Method).&nbsp; Today, we are looking at even more guidance released under the FAD PReP banner.  &nbs",

As of January 31, 2015, a total of 504 human cases of H7N9 had been confirmed in Mainland China, with the H7 and H9 subtypes responsible for more than 180 deaths, giving a global mortality rate of over 35.71%.",

A universal paediatric influenza vaccination programme using a quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) has recently been introduced in the UK. This study aims to measure the end-of-season influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), including for LAIV, using the test negative case-control design. The overall adjusted VE against all influenza was 34.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 17.8 to 47.5); for A(H3N2) 29.3% (95% CI: 8.6 to 45.3) and for B 46.3% (95% CI: 13.9 to 66.5). For those aged under 18 years, influenza A(H3N2) LAIV VE was 35% (95% CI: 29.9 to 67.5), whereas for influenza B the LAIV VE was 100% (95% CI:17.0 to 100.0). Although the VE against influenza A(H3N2) infection was low, there was still evidence of significant protection, together with moderate, significant protection against drifted circulating influenza B viruses. LAIV provided non-significant positive protection against influenza A, with significant protection against B. Further work to assess the population impact of the vaccine programme across the UK is underway.",

The overall adjusted VE against all influenza was 34.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 17.8 to 47.5); for A(H3N2) 29.3% (95% CI: 8.6 to 45.3) and for B 46.3% (95% CI: 13.9 to 66.5). For those aged under 18 years, influenza A(H3N2) LAIV VE was 35% (95% CI: 29.9 to 67.5), whereas for influenza B the LAIV VE was 100% (95% CI:17.0 to 100.0). Although the VE against influenza A(H3N2) infection was low, there was still evidence of significant protection, together with moderate, significant protection against drifted circulating influenza B viruses. LAIV provided non-significant positive protection against influenza A, with significant protection against B. Further work to assess the population impact of the vaccine programme across the UK is underway.",

Todays study, appearing in the open access journal mBio, takes a much deeper look at the complete genome sequences, and describes instead what they believe to have been a relatively recent recombination of the MERS coronavirus virus.  &nbsp; In very simple terms (which is about all I can manage), recombination is similar in concept to the reassortment we see with influenza viruses, although in practice it differs considerably.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Influenza is a segmented virus, and during reassortment entire gene segments are swapped.&nbsp; Most non-influenza viruses are not segmented, and so with recombination, only a small section of genetic material is exchanged.  &nbsp; Im the first to admit that interpreting all of this is well above my pay grade, so Im happy to say we have a plain-language commentary from none other than Dr. Ian Lipkin  world renown virus hunter and the Director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University",

Potential spread of H3N1 or H3N2 that carries the human-like H3 could have significant impact in swine herds due to poor herd immunity as well as potential public health ramifications. Preliminary findings by the USDA-ARS from testing of one of these H3N1 isolates with the human-like H3 gene in swine indicate the virus is fully virulent, causing typical influenza disease. &nbsp; As we saw w",
